Though the film is set in contemporary L.A., at first sight, Milanda and her environs (burnt-out houses overgrown with weeds) might seem to be located in Africa or the Caribbean, or at some time in the past. Structured as an Africanist ritual for Barbara McCullough’s “participant-viewers,” the film addresses how conditions of poverty, exploitation and anger render the Los Angeles landscape not as the fabled promised land for Black migrants, but as both cause and emblem of Black desolation.

Against Matisse-like colour palettes and impressionistic-resolutions, the central figure of “Glide” is a woman floating on a lantern-helmed rowboat. We float through various angles and perspectives as she’s drawn languidly towards a collective future. The screen blends between settings that emerge from sky to ocean and from canvas to characters coming together in a watery dreamscape that enacts a mysterious ritual. The soundtrack voices the oceanic and star-lit setting. Think Vangelis in an Aeolian reverie of golden hues. Think, ponder and glide.\n",

      " Two years after Jason Parks (Landy Cannon) saved Warrior Princess Summer Vale (Brigitte Kingsley) from her life hunting Killopoths in the demon dimension, a sudden surge of supernatural activity and violent attacks have resurfaced on our plane beyond the normal parameters of the portal. The Rising Dark Agency, a black ops division of the government headed by Colonel Haggerd (Michael Ironside), suspects that the mystic strikes suggests the work of Mardock, an evil Demon-god capable of destroying worlds. When a new demon sub-species disrupts Summer's wedding and eats her fiancée, the war on the new Demon Lord begins. With her group of misfits and their BFG's - Summer sets out to destroy Mardock, but no one is prepared for who they find behind the Dark Lord's ascension.\n",
